# This project is mainly for research purposes.

*This repo might not arrange in the right order, because it was meant to be a research repo.*
*However is a research repo for me to implement it in any real life example.*
*Free to have a look for public, but please do not use it as commercial use as some of the product is from online.*

The research are included below:
- VFX research, VFX Graph included.
- Shader URP research. Combination with VFX Graph.
- CI/CD Unity Research with Github Action. Automation Build.
- Custom Scripting for plugin.
- and more in the future.
